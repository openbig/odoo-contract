OpenBIG Odoo Contract Management

 Sell products and manage the contract
=====================================

 This module adds some functionality to clean up the 
 usability of contract maintenance. The purpose is to 
 forward sales order lines of licensed or subscribed 
 products to projects to create, apply or extend a 
 contract directly from a task.

 Contract Creation
 -----------------

 Contract managers may open generated tasks to create directly 
 from this view a new contract or to assign an existing contract. 
 The automatically assigned contract templates apply product or 
 sale order related data like customer or contract 
 contact / contract ownwer, start and end dates, recurrent 
 billing and reminder options.
